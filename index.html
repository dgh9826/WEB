  My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student,
  and she decided to put me up for adoption. <br>She felt very strongly
  that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was
  all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.
  Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute
  that they really wanted a girl.
  <br>So my parents, who were on a
  waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking:
  "We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?" They said:
   "Of course." My biological mother later found out that my mother
   had never graduated from college and that my father had never
   graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption
   papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents
   promised that I would someday go to college.</p>
